- Think about what I would like to achieve or improve and which tasks I need to do to reach there
- Divide those big tasks into smaller tasks, do them regularly/everyday to train brain to get used to them and develop (new) good habits
- Work on my brain to focus on the tasks that I program and avoid procrastination 
- Realize that concentration, self-discipline and a calm mind help a lot
